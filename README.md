# 66-Days-of-Data

<h2>This is my work in 66 Days of Data</h2>

<h3>This repository will be updated whenever i learn something new or go back and build the things I already 
know but by taking care of even smaller things. This repository focuses on data, so in any code, the priority is to clean
the data and find patterns.
</h3>

Readme needs to be updated. #hacktoberfest
